# Re:ðŸ”„ Recursion series
## Re 1: Intro to recursion ðŸŒ€
A recursion MUST have a **'Base case'** to stop the recursion finitely.(Else segmentation fault/ stack overflow)

Always try to visualize recursion by **recursion tree or call stack**
## Re 2: Basic recursion problems
### 1. print name 5 times
```
void f(i,n) ...... O(n)
    if(i>n)
        return ;  //base case
    print("Meow");
    f(i+1);    //recursive call
main : call f(0,n)
```
